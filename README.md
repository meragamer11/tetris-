# tetris-
#It was difficult in certain parts of making the game, 
#learning to use the database was one because at times the code would come up as incorrect 
#or the folder would not be detected. Making the movement of the blocks was another problem 
#because at first it seems difficult to figure out how to make the movement of the blocks 
#but making the keyboard detect it was complicated for me although after a little research 
#I found out how to make the arrows on the keyboard move the Tetris blocks, the music was 
#the easy part of this project because it was downloading a song and uploading it to a folder being an mp3 file.
